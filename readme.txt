Welcome to my portfolio!  

I've been a software developer part-time for decades alongside my crazy entrepreneurial projects in entertainment and escape room design that have taken me around the world with adventures of all kinds for two decades.  Over the years I've written escape room tech, a corporate intranet/CRM/CMS from scratch and web resources in HTML/CSS/JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, Python, Arduino-C/C++, and a wee bit of Java.

But mostly - I'm your SHOPIFY GUY!  I'm using my experience as a business success coach and software engineer to help others grow their businesses now. My shameless self-promotion for that is at www.TheShopifyGuy.net.  There are also some good demo videos of the kinds of Shopify services I have been providing as a freelancer on my brand new Upwork profile at https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01b92ac192749096c7.

My shopify expertise comes from Freemote - the leader in Shopify freelancer education.  I am also trained in computer science with degrees from University of the People and Radford University.  And I have recently been buffing up my software engineering skills at Springboard's well-respected intensive bootcamp. 

Their I have been getting up-to-the-minute with the newest, best and brightest technologies like Python/Flask, PostgreSQL/SQLAlchemy, AJAX/RESTful API's, JavaScript flavors like jQuery/jQuery-UI, Node.JS, REACT, a bunch of different testing platforms and more.

If you are looking for a great, creative software engineer then look no farther!  I have the soft skills of a trained life coach, the creativity of an entertainer/inventor, the work ethic of a self-employed parent and the modesty of... well... okay... this IS a marketing platform isn't it?  Whose gonna toot my horn if I don't!?
