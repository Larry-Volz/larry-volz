Welcome to my portfolio!  

I'm a hypnotherapist by trade (for over 20 years) but have enjoyed amateur and occassional freelance software development since I was a kid. I recently just earned an associates in computer science and certifications in software engineering and shopify development.

Mostly, if I'm doing development it's for escape room inventions. 

I've also been an entertainer (comedy hypnotist and magician) for decades.  My crazy entrepreneurial projects in entertainment and escape room design have taken me around the world with adventures of all kinds for two decades.  

Over the years I've written escape room tech, a corporate intranet/CRM/CMS from scratch and web resources in HTML/CSS/JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, Python, Arduino-C/C++, and a wee bit of Java.

I've also enjoyed some teaching at CodeWizardsHQ where I had more fun doing Scratch with kids than I ever thought possible :)
