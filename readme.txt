Welcome to my portfolio!  

I've been a web developer part-time for decades alongside my crazy entrepreneurial projects that have taken me around the world with adventures of all kinds.  And now I have decided to settle down and turn the hobby into my full-time gig and just do the occasional show or design the occassional escape room.

To that end I've just earned my second degree - this one in computer science.  And I am finishing up a competitive boot camp program with Springboard in software engineering so that I will be up-to-the-minute with the newest, best and brightest technologies.

If you are looking for a great, creative software engineer then look no farther!  I have the soft skills of a therapist, the creativity of an entertainer/inventor, and the work ethic of a self-employed parent.

Oh... and regarding the portfolio file:  It's a bootstrap-based template that I updated and put my own unique twists on.  That tends to be my M.O. with web dev nowadays since there is no point in re-inventing the wheel.  There's nothing in the template that I could not re-create from scratch using the same libraries.  jQuery, JavaScript and Bootstrap are my jam :)
