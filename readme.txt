Welcome to my portfolio!  

I've been a software developer part-time for decades alongside my crazy entrepreneurial projects in entertainment and escape room design that have taken me around the world with adventures of all kinds for two decades.  Over the years I've written escape room tech, a corporate intranet/CRM/CMS from scratch and web resources in HTML/CSS/JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, Python, Arduino-C/C++, and a wee bit of Java.

As I am getting older I  have decided to settle down a bit (just a bit).  

I recently finished a degree in computer science at University of the People.  I am finishing up an advanced software engineering bootcamp at Springboard.  And now I am switching things up in a mid-life career pivot: turning the lifetime hobby into a full-time profession and the old gigs into the weekend hobbies.

To that end I have been getting up-to-the-minute with the newest, best and brightest technologies like Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, AJAX/REST API's, JavaScript, jQuery/jQuery-UI, Node.JS, REACT, various testing platforms and more.

If you are looking for a great, creative software engineer then look no farther!  I have the soft skills of a trained life coach, the creativity of an entertainer/inventor, and the work ethic of a self-employed parent.
